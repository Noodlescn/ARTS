### 3. Tips
This week, I have no tip to share.

### 4. Share

I'm reading \<Code Complete\> by Steve McConnell.
I will share about Part 2:
 1. The Pseudocode Programming Process
    - Use English-like statements that precisely describe specific operations.
    - Avoid syntactic elements from the target programming language.
    - Describe the meaning of the approach rather than how the approach will be implemented in the target language.
    - Write pseudocode at a low enough level that generating code from it will be nearly automatic.

- Once the pseudocode is written, you build the code around it and the pseudocode turns into programming-language comments.

2. Contructing Routines by Using the PPP
    - Design the routine
        - Define the problem the routine will solve
            - The information the routine will hide.
            - Inputs to the routine.
            - Outputs from the routine.
            - Preconditions that are guaranteed to be true before the routine is called.
            - Postconditions that the routine guarantees will be true before it passes control back to the caller.
    - Code the routine
    - Check the code
    - Clean up loose ends
    - Repeat as needed
